# smc\_3d\_plotting


python code and data files to plot the magellanic cloud cepheids in 3d. 

should be compatible with python 2.7 and 3.5

run in ipython:

``` python

ipython --pylab

run -i ./map_of_mcsystem.py

```

Interactive 3d plot of system will come up in new window

Haven't tracked down where I saved the code for fig. 9 yet, but you can reproduce it using this data.
